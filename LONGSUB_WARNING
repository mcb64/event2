The longSub record value fields a-z are unsigned long, *not* EpicsUInt32.

This produces a problem in evrPatternProc, when we pass in a pointer to the "d" field to
evrTimeGetFromPipeline and expect it to be treated as an evrModifier_ta, which is an
array of 6 EpicsUInt32.

In the actual pattern, evrMessagePattern_ts, the modifier_a field *is* an array of epicsUInt32.
The right thing seems to happen in evrTimeGetFromPipeline though, where these will be expanded.

We have the same issue with evrMessageCounts and evrMessageCountsFiducial, so all of these
have been changed to unsigned long as well.
