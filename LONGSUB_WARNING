The longSub record value fields a-z are unsigned long, *not*
EpicsUInt32.
### NOTE: I don't think this is true.
### Looks like they are now, and always have been epicsUInt32, and
### a sizeof(epicsUInt32) printf shows 4 bytes.
### However, it looks like mcb fixed the internal value handling in rev 10075,
### 2/7/2012, which was previously using long instead of epicsUInt32.
### bhill 6/25/2014

This produces a problem in evrPatternProc, when we pass in a pointer
to the "d" field to evrTimeGetFromPipeline and expect it to be treated
as an evrModifier_ta, which is an array of 6 EpicsUInt32.

In the actual pattern, evrMessagePattern_ts, the modifier_a field *is*
an array of epicsUInt32.  The right thing seems to happen in
evrTimeGetFromPipeline though, where these will be expanded.

We have the same issue with evrMessageCounts and
evrMessageCountsFiducial, so all of these have been changed to
unsigned long as well.
